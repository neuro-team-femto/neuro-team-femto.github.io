Anaïs Llorens is a cognitive neuroscientist at the CNRS/FEMTO-ST in Besançon and the Institute of Psychiatry And Neuroscience de Paris. After obtaining her PhD at Aix-Marseille University in 2014, she pursued her research at the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane (Australia), followed by a first postdoc at the University of Oslo (Norway) and a second one at the University of California, Berkeley (USA). Her research combines behavioral experiments coupled with electrophysiological recordings (EEG and intraEEG) conducted with control and pathological populations to study the brain mechanisms involved in interindividual communication such as working memory, language and emotion. In parallel to her research, Anaïs Llorens is active in initiatives promoting equity and diversity in STEM.
